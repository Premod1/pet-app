        or a seasoned pro, we have everything you need to keep your furry

        offerings, we also support the local animal rescue community through our
        partnership with Sherlock Rescue, a dedicated team of animal lovers who
        are committed to rescuing and rehabilitating dogs in need. At Jack Pet
        Supplies, we proudly display posters, host adoption events, and
